# HtzDNS
This is a dynamic DNS udpater for Hetzner [DNS robot](https://dns.hetzner.com).

TL;DR: Rewrite of hetzner-dyndns php script in bash, so we can run on a weak openwrt/ddwrt router from cron.

## Is this for me? (checklist):
- Do you want to access computers at a remote location?
- Do you host stuff on premise, with no cloud access?
- Does your ISP change your IP address every once in a while?
- Do you want to avoid paying monthly for a DYNDNS service, or update free tier every so often?
- Do you have a domain at Hetzner?
- Would a mysite.mydomain.tld sound good to you?

If you answered with "no" to any of the above questions, this is not for you. In any other case, read on.


- Run this from cron periodically.
- It is written in bash, so it runs on weaker routers, rasp pi, or any modern microwave oven. 

# Usage
## Prerequisites
1) Make sure you see your DNS zones in "Your zones" when you login to https://dns.hetzner.com
2) In your profile/API Tokens (https://dns.hetzner.com/settings/api-token) generate an access token, and give it a name, for example: htzdns (note: the token, a 32 chars long alphanumeric hash is displayed only once).
3) You may want to help yourself and lower the TTL on those records you're looking to update, for fast dns resolution change that is.
4) Create a backup of your zone files, just in case something goes sideways (not that I expect it).

On the dependencies front, the only non-standard \*nix package you will need is jq (for handling json objects). This is available for ARMv7, MIPS, X86, and pretty much any linux distro; and brew will install this on MacOS too.

## Configure
Run htzdns.sh -r to rebuild configuration for your host:

```
$ cd htzdns/
$ ./htzdns.sh -r
‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: Could not find config: htzdns-testhost.conf

‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: No API key was found, launching builder.

‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: No zone mapping config was found, launching builder

Ok, let's rebuild configuration.
Configuration will be: htzdns-testhost.
üîë API key set:
   Please go to https://dns.hetzner.com/settings/api-token, generate an API token, and provide it here: 
```

Enter your Hetzner API key you obtained from dns.htzner.com


```
   üîó Checking mapping configuration...

   ‚öôÔ∏è  mbag.at has the following configuration options:
    [1] www
    [2] vpn

   Records marked with ‚úÖ are currently configured.
   Swith these on/off individually by typing the line number, or hit enter to continue [1-2]:
   
```

Only A records are displayed, and you won't see "localhost" or "@" records by default.
Select the records you want to update, and they will get marked in an updated list display.

```

Configuration updated, here's your new list:

    [1] www
    [2] vpn ‚úÖ

   Records marked with ‚úÖ are currently configured.
   Swith these on/off individually by typing the line number, or hit enter to continue [1-2]:

```

You can keep turning them on, but when you're done switching, hit enter.
This process will continue going through all your configured domain names, and all the A records.
Eventually, you will get to the point where the configuration is shown and you are asked if you want it saved:

```
‚åõ Building config...
‚úÖ Configuration is successfully constructed.

üëÅÔ∏è  Please take a moment to eyeball the configuration below,
   and confirm that ./htzdns-rt0.conf can be updated.

### Automatically generated htzdns-rt0.conf (2020-05-12 21:04:23):
### for manual modifications, take a peak in htzdns.conf, we have quite some docs there.

Are we OK to save to ./htzdns-rt0.conf? (Y/n)
```
The above configuration is an example *with invalid api key, host and record info* - only for representation.
Hit Y and enter to save the config.

## Usage
Normally you run this on its own, and allow hosts to be updated.
However, there are usage flags you can use:

```
   -r | r | --rebuild	Run configuration builder (interactive)
   -p | p | --pretend   Do not make any changes, only show what would be done.
   -v | v | --verbose   See what is happening.
   -t | t | --test      Run tests (confirms compatibilty, warns on significant API changes)
   -h | h | --help	This usage manual.
```
It is recommended to run this with the -p flag for the first time to see if you run into any obvious errors.
The -v flag will spit out a bunch of more information (verbose).
The -vv flag acts as double verbose, e.g. not only debug functions are reported, but values sent back & forth between internal functions too.

Check update on your hetzner domain control ui.
If all looks cool, feel free to cron this for every minute.

### Under the hood
Few things to keep in mind:
1. It is safe to run this every minute, as a local cache file is present with the configured hosts and values, you will not be hitting the API unless there is a change in your IP.
2. Depending on whatismyip - this tool has a few hosts configured, you won't be hitting the same host over and over again with this either.
